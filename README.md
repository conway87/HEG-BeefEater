BeefEater is a double downed version of **[HEG](https://github.com/conway87/HEG-3.0)**. It generates way more events with less hand holding. BeefEater is not for casuals. This version of HEG is geared for people who need to see a multitude of events that might only have slight variations.â€¨

e.g. *What events would be generated from modifying a registry key in cmd versus modifying it in JScript? In that scenario would you get better telemetry from Windows Security or Sysmon?*
