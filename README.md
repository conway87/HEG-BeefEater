***

BeefEater is a double downed version of **[HEG](https://github.com/conway87/HEG-3.0)**. It generates way more events with less hand holding. BeefEater is not for casuals. This version of HEG is geared for people who need to see a multitude of events that might only have slight variations.â€¨

e.g. *What events would be generated from modifying a registry key in cmd versus modifying it in JScript? In that scenario would you get better telemetry from Windows Security or Sysmon?*

1. Read the wiki over on the main HEG repo. For quick start:
   
    * Download and extract repo
    * Make sure folder containg main script is called 'HEG' (\HEG\HEG.ps1)
    * Launch PowerShell as admin
    * Locate and run `HEG.ps1`
    * After it completes, check the Logs directory
